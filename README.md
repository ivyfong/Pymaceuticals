# Unit 5 â€“ Matplotlib Homework, Pymaceuticals

The objective of this project is to analyze data on mice treated with a variety of drug regimes to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare in treating squamous cell carcinoma, a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. Using Matplotlib, scatter plots were created to show how the tumor volume, number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites, and number of mice alive changed during the 45 days of treatment for each drug regime. A bar graph was also created to compare the total % tumor volume change during treatment for each drug regime.
