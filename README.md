## **Objective:**
The objective of this project is to analyze data on mice treated with a variety of drug regimes to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare in treating squamous cell carcinoma, a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. 

Using Matplotlib, the following graphs were created:
* Scatter plot: Treatment duration (days) vs. tumor volume.
* Scatter plot: Treatment duration (days) vs. number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites.
* Scatter plot: Treatment duration (days) vs. survival rate (%).
* Bar graph: Treatment vs. total % tumor volume change.

## **Tools:**
1. Python -  Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy
